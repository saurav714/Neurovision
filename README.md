🧠 Neural Network Visualization

Interactive Web-Based Neural Network PlaygroundBuilt with HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript

💡 Design, Edit, and Visualize Neural Networks like never before — from MLP to Transformers.

🔥 Features

🎧️ Custom Architectures

Create networks with 2–20 input/output nodes

Configure up to 10 hidden layers, each with 2–20 nodes

Easy layer control with "+" and "–" buttons or number inputs

⚡ Preset Architectures

Choose from a rich variety of popular models:

MLP, Deep MLP

CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU

Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

Transformer

GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)

Spiking Neural Network (SNN)

ResNet-style architectures

🎨 Interactive Editing

Click on nodes or connections to adjust weights

Real-time updates with:

↑ / ↓ keys (±0.1)

R to randomize

Delete / Backspace to zero weights

Bulk editing options available

🧪 Visualization

Animated Forward Pass and Backpropagation

Node size scales with weight magnitude

Recurrent and special connections drawn with intuitive visuals

Supports view and edit modes

📊 Stats & UI

Total parameter counter (weights + biases)

Sleek responsive UI with gradients and blur effects

Architecture-specific node rendering (e.g., LSTM cells as rectangles)
